/**
 * Deployment Fix Report
 *
 * This file documents the fixes made to resolve deployment errors related to missing exports.
 *
 * Issues Fixed:
 *
 * 1. lib/supabase/server.ts
 *    - Added missing named export: createClient
 *    - This export is required by components that use Supabase authentication
 *
 * 2. lib/ai/hybrid-search.ts
 *    - Added missing named export: searchDocuments
 *    - Created as an alias to hybridSearch for backward compatibility
 *    - This export is required by search components
 *
 * 3. lib/pinecone/client.ts
 *    - Added missing named export: getPineconeStats
 *    - Created as an alias to getIndexStats for backward compatibility
 *    - This export is required by analytics components
 *
 * Implementation Approach:
 *
 * For each missing export, we either:
 * 1. Re-exported an existing import (createClient from @supabase/supabase-js)
 * 2. Created an alias to an existing function (searchDocuments → hybridSearch)
 * 3. Created an alias to an existing function (getPineconeStats → getIndexStats)
 *
 * This approach maintains backward compatibility without adding new functionality
 * or changing existing behavior.
 *
 * Next Steps:
 *
 * 1. Update components to use the primary function names directly
 * 2. Add deprecation warnings to the alias exports
 * 3. Eventually remove the aliases in a future refactoring
